# KnowMe
- Used Swift and Firebase as database to develop an iOS app called KnowMe
- Purpose is to help high school students better manage their time and find what their
True interests are.
- User inputs how much time he or she is spending on an activity or subject and rates
it on a scale of one through five.
- Data is stored in database and over time users can use a calendar type interface to
select a date range and generate charts that show how much total time they are spending on each activity and how interested they are about the activity based on the hours inputted and how many stars they rate the activity.

Here is a demo of how the app works:
